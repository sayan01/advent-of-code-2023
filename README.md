# 🎄❄️ Advent of Sayan ⛄🔔

This repository contains my codes for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions.
I am aiming to reach 50 stars (that is, not missing any day of AOC23).
The solutions are majorly in python, the language I am currently most familiar with.
The code uses pythonic/functional approaches when possible to create concise code.

The reason of making this repository public is to share my solutions with others (after leaderboard is saturated).

An alias I use (but not included in this repo directly) is

```bash
alias aoc='mcd $HOME/docs/projects/aoc23/$(date +%d)'
```

where `mcd` is a script to `mkdir -p` and `cd` into `$1`.

Merry Christmas!
