# 🎄❄️ Advent of Sayan ⛄🔔
This repository contains my codes for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions.
I am aiming to reach 50 stars (that is, not missing any day of AOC23).
The solutions are majorly in python, the language I am currently most familiar with.
The code uses pythonic/functional approaches when possible to create concise code.

The reason of making this repository public is to share my solutions with others (after leaderboard is saturated).

Merry Christmas!
